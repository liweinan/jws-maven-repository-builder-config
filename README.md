Maven Repository Builder
========================

Build a Maven repository from a list of dependencies and the URL to an existing repository.
The list can be generated from defined sources like MEAD tag, remote/local repository or a
set of top level artifacts, which dependencies are included. This way there can be combined
several sources. Another way is to provide the artifact list in a file and call the builder
with single source URL. This tool requires python 2.6 or higher.

There is a set of tools in the repository. The complete list of them is:
* **Maven Repository Builder (maven_repo_builder.sh)**
    * builds a Maven repository
    * uses Artifact List Generator and Maven Repository Metadata Generator
* **Maven Repository Comparator (compare_repositories.py)**
    * compares two repositories to see if they contain matching GAVs
* **Artifact List Generator (artifact_list_generator.py)**
    * generates list of artifact and filters it according to config file
* **Maven Repository Metadata Generator (generate_maven_metadata.sh)**
    * generates Maven metadata xml files for usage as a local repository


Maven Repository Builder Usage
------------------------------

    Usage:
        maven_repo_builder.sh -u URL [-r REPO_FILENAME] [-m] [-o OUTPUT] [-b OUTPUT_REPO] [-a CLASSIFIERS] [-s CHECKSUM_MODE] [-x EXCLUDED_TYPES] [-d ADDITION] FILE...
        or
        maven_repo_builder.sh -c CONFIG [-r REPO_FILENAME] [-m] [-o OUTPUT] [-b OUTPUT_REPO] [-a CLASSIFIERS] [-s CHECKSUM_MODE] [-x EXCLUDED_TYPES] [-d ADDITION]

    Generate a Maven repository based on a file (or files) containing a list of artifacts.  Each list file must contain
    a single artifact per line in the format groupId:artifactId:fileType:<classifier>:version The example artifact list
    contains more information. Another usage is to provide Artifact List Generator configuration file.

    Options:
      -h                    show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG
                            Configuration file to use to generate an artifact list
                            for the repository builder
      -u URL
                            Comma-separated list of URLs of the remote repositories from
                            which artifacts are downloaded. It is used along with artifact
                            list files when no config file is specified.
      -o OUTPUT
                            Local output directory for the new repository. By default
                            "local-maven-repository" will be used.
      -b OUTPUT_REPO
                            Name of directory in which will be the artifracts contained in the
                            output direcotry. It can be empty or multi-level path,
                            e.g. path/to/repo. Defaults to "maven-repository".
      -a CLASSIFIERS
                            Colon-separated list of additional classifiers to download.
                            By default "sources" will be used. It is possible to use
                            "__all__" to request all available classifiers (works only when
                            artifact list is generated from config). There can be a type
                            specified with each classifiers separated by colon, e.g. jar:sources.
                            The old way of separation of classifiers by colon is deprecated since.
      -r REPO_FILENAME
                            Zip teh created repository in a file with provided name
      -s CHECKSUM_MODE
                            Mode of dealing with MD5 and SHA1 checksums. Possible options are:
                            generate - generate the checksums (default)
                            download - download the checksums if available, if not, generate them
                            check - check if downloaded and generated checksums are equal

      -m
                            Generate metadata in the created repository
      -l LOGLEVEL
                            Set the level of log output.  Can be set to debug,
                            info, warning, error, or critical
      -L LOGFILE
                            Set the file in which the log output should be written
      -d ADDITION
                            Directory containing additional files for the repository.
                            Content of directory ADDITION will be copied to the repository.

[Example Repository List](https://github.com/jboss-eap/maven-repository-builder/blob/master/example-config/artifact-list.txt)


Maven Repository Comparator

A script is also included which can be used to compare two repositories to see if they
contain matching GAVs (artifacts with the same groupId, artifactId, and version).

    Usage: compare_repositories.py [options] REPOSITORY_PATH

    Compare a local Maven repository to a remote repository.

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
                            Set the level of log output.  Can be set to debug,
                            info, warning, error, or critical
      -L LOGFILE, --logfile=LOGFILE
                            Set the file in which the log output should be
                            written.
      -u URL, --url=URL     URL of the remote repository to use for comparison


Artifact List Generator
-----------------------
The Artifact List Generator is a tool which handles generation of artifact list from specified sources. It is used by
maven_repo_builder.py or it can be used as a separate tool. Configuration structure is described below.

    Usage:
        artifact_list_generator.py -c CONFIG

    Generates an artifact list according to provided configuration. The output of the script is a list of repository
    URLs and artifacts separated by tab character per line. Every artifact is in format
    groupId:artifactId:fileType:version. The output is printed on stdout.

    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG, --config=CONFIG
                            Configuration file to use for generation of an
                            artifact list for the repository builder
      -a CLASSIFIERS, --classifiers=CLASSIFIERS
                            Comma-separated list of additional classifiers to
                            download. It is possible to use "__all__" to request
                            all available classifiers. There can be a type
                            specified with each classifiers separated by colon,
                            e.g. sources:jar.
      -x EXCLUDEDTYPES, --excludedtypes=EXCLUDEDTYPES
                            Colon-separated list of filetypes to exclude. Defaults
                            to zip:ear:war:tar:gz:tar.gz:bz2:tar.bz2:7z:tar.7z.
      --nocache             Don't use any cache (dependency graph cache etc).
      -w WHITELIST, --whitelist=WHITELIST
                            Name of a file containing GATCV patterns allowing
                            usage of stars or regular expressions when enclosed in
                            "r/pattern/". It can force inclusion of artifacts with
                            excluded types.
      -l LOGLEVEL, --loglevel=LOGLEVEL
                            Set the level of log output. Can be set to debug,
                            info, warning, error, or critical
      -L LOGFILE, --logfile=LOGFILE
                            Set the file in which the log output should be
                            written.

    permitted multiple versions. Not required, used only when **single-version** = "true".


Maven Repository Metadata Generator
-----------------------------------
There is a script used by Maven Repository Builder for metadata generator. It can be used
separately from the builder.

    Usage: generate_maven_metadata.sh [REPOSITORY_PATH]

    Generates metadata in specified directory. If none is specified then current workdir
    is used. It is needed to pass the repository root as parameter, because it converts
    the relative path to artifacts into group ID, artifact ID and version. If it wasn't
    the repository root, the group ID would be probably wrong or the whole tool would end
    up with an error.
