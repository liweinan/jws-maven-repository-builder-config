# This is an example artifact list for the maven_repository_builder.py tool
# Lines starting with a '#' are considered comments, and are ignored by the tool

# The basic format for artifacts in the list is 
# groupId:artifactId:fileType:<classifier>:version
org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils:jar:3.0.8


# Comments placed on the same line as a GAV are ok
junit:junit:jar:4.1  # Include junit for tests


# Whitespace before and after the artifact GAV is ignored
    org.apache.maven:maven-artifact:3.0.1    


# If the fileType of the artifact is set to "jar", the repository builder will 
# attempt to download both the pom file and a matching -sources artifact for
# the given jar artifact.
# If the artifact type is set to "pom" then the repository builder will
# download only the pom file, and not attempt to download a -sources artifact
org.apache.maven:maven-parent:pom:20


# If a classifier is included in the GAV string, the artifact with the 
# specified classifier will be downloaded instead of the main artifact
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:zip:source-release:3.0


# Dependency scope appended to a GAV will be ignored by the repository builder
org.apache.maven:maven-plugin-api:jar:3.0.1:compile


# A regex is used to match the GAV, so additional text which does not include
# a matching GAV will be ignored.  For example, this is useful for properly 
# parsing the output of a "mvn dependency:list" command.
